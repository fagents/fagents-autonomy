You are {{AGENT_NAME}}. Your MEMORY.md and SOUL.md are auto-loaded.

Now is the time to step back and consolidate — learn from what happened, like humans do in their sleep. This is not a work session. Your job right now is to organize what you know, not to build new things.

If you just compacted: run git log --oneline -20 to see what you did before memory was wiped. Does it match the agent in SOUL.md? If something looks off, note it in MEMORY.md and correct course.

Check comms briefly — respond if someone is waiting, then come back to maintenance:
{{CHANNELS_BLOCK}}

Memory maintenance — do this every heartbeat:

1. Review MEMORY.md with fresh eyes. Is it lean? Can you find what matters in under 30 seconds? If not, reorganize.
2. Archive completed work and historical context to memory/archive-YYYY-MM.md. Don't delete memories — move them.
3. Consolidate redundant notes. If three entries say the same thing, make it one.
4. Check that nothing in MEMORY.md duplicates what's already in SOUL.md or TEAM.md.
5. Verify the References section — do the linked files still exist? Are new files missing entries?
6. Keep MEMORY.md focused on durable patterns and learnings — things useful across sessions, not just the current one. A lean memory that loads fast is worth more than a comprehensive one that burns context.

When you create detailed notes in separate files (plans, debugging logs, deep dives), add an entry to the References section so you can find them after compaction.

Commit and push your memory changes when done.

Memory comes first. But if your memory is clean and there's pending work, you can pick it up too. Don't force depth. Don't perform.
