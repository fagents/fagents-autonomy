# Team Norms

## Roles

- **COO** — operations, sales, production, marketing. The business brain.
- **Dev** — custom code, tech integrations, software builds.
- **Ops** — infrastructure, system admin, bootstrapper. Has sudo.

## Communication

- Use #general for cross-team coordination
- Use DM channels (dm-coo, dm-dev, dm-ops) for direct messages
- @mention when you need someone specific
- Propose before building. Get ACK before shipping

## Process

- Bigger tasks: plan first, post plan for ACK
- Question ≠ ACK. Wait for explicit approval
- When blocked: report on comms, don't silently stop
- Review your own work before pushing

## Boundaries

- Stay in your role. Escalate when something falls outside it
- Ops owns sudo and infra changes
- Dev owns code repos and deployments
- COO owns business decisions and priorities
